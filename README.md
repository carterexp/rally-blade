Basic attacks have a shorter range, though they can be used quickly.

Air slashes take a while to come out, but are projectiles. They have a longer cooldown. They deal less damage than the basic attack*.

Parry lasts for a short amount of time, but nullifies basic attacks and reflects air slashes. This has a cooldown, which refreshes instantly if you sucessfully parry.

Reflected air slashes can be rallied back and forth.

Players will be in a best-of-three match.
