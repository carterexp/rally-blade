Basic attacks have a shorter range, though they can be used quickly.

Air slashes take a while to come out, but are projectiles. They have a longer cooldown. They deal less damage than the basic attack.

Parry lasts for a short amount of time, but nullifies basic attacks and air slashes, and has a short cooldown.

Reflecting air slashes can result in a tennis-like rally.

Players will be in a best-of-three match.
